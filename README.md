# Visualization of Polar ice cap melting

A data visualization app which depicts the declining extent of the North polar ice cap melting over the past years. I built the app using React and integrated New Relic APM tool to study and observe user time on the site, page views, page load times, track the app performance and other analytics.

## Tools

- React
- New Relic APM
- Material UI
- Zing Chart

## Environment
